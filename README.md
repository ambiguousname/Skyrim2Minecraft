# How to Run
1. Clone the repo. (`git clone https://github.com/ambiguousname/Skyrim2Minecraft.git`)
2. Copy `Skyrim.esm` from your Skyrim game and copy it to this folder.
3. [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
4. Run `cargo run` in the terminal.
5. Copy the outputted `.mca` files into the `region` folder of your [Minecraft save](https://minecraft.wiki/w/World).
6. Note that this program assumes that it can generate blocks anywhere from y-level `-592` to `624`, so you may need to use a datapack to increase the y-limit of the overworld! Or just [download the custom world](https://drive.proton.me/urls/HVWNDC03T0#VKyc404VoD40). 

Please note that this program has only been tested with Skyrim: Special Edition, it may not work on older versions.
